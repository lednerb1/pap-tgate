# Feeding the beast

The python application is responsible for registering.

C++ code goes as followed:
* Define new Catraca and type of person allowed
* Get a list from the server of those allowed people
* Input is a bunch of CPF until EOF
* Every 10 new inputs send data back to server (pipe in entradas.txt)

## TODO

* Add OOP: instead of adding CPF to the array, add a new
  instance of a Person or child classes
* Better CSS
